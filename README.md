## INSTRUCTIONS
1.Connect the Pi SenseHAT to the RaspBerry Pi \
2.Connect to the RaspBerry Pi using SSH \
3.Upload the code to the Pi using scp command <br>
4.Run the code to get the output Conclusion   
## CONCLUSION
This lab focused on sensor interfacing using the RaspBerry Pi 5 and Sense HAT.The primary goals were to control the LED matrix to display messages and retrieve real time environmental data(temperature, Humidity, and Pressure) using python.These tasks are foundational for embedded AI and Robotics.
